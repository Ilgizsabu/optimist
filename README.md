# Optimist

**Project Description**

This project is an interactive program that finds out if a person is an optimist or a pessimist through a series of questions about a glass of water.

1. Start: Fill a glass halfway with water and ask the user, "The glass is 50% full. Is it half empty or half full?"
2. Based on the answer (using confirm), if the user says "half full," remove half of the remaining water and ask the next question: "The glass is 25% full. Is it three-quarters empty or one-quarter full?"
3. Continue asking questions until the user changes their answer to the opposite.
4. Result: If the user first answered "half full," they are an optimist. If they answered "half empty," they are a pessimist. Finally, calculate the percentage of water at which the user changed their answer.
